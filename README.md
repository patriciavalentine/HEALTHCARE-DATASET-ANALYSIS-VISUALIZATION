This data analysis & visualization project aims to provide insights into the healthcare performance of several health facilities in the United States.

By analyzing and visualizing various parts of the healthcare data, I sought to identify trends and gain a deeper understanding of the healthcare performance.

## Data Sources
Healthcare_Dataset:
The primary dataset used for this analysis is the 'heathcare_dataset.csv' file, containing detailed information about the healthcare systems' patients' names, ages, genders, medical conditions, insurance providers, blood groups, billing amounts, doctors, days of admission and hospitals attended.

## Tools
- Microsoft SQL Server - Data Cleaning & Analysis
- PowerBI - Data Visualizations

## Data Cleaning / Preparation
In the initial data preparation phase, I performed the following tasks:
1. Data loading & inspection.
2. Checking missing values and blanks.
3. Data cleaning & formatting.

## Exploratory Data Analysis
EDA involved exploring the healthcare data to answer key questions, such as:
1. Is there a correlation between gender and specific medical conditions?
2. What are the most common medical conditions across different age groups?
3. Which doctors are preferred for specific conditions?
4. What is the average billing amount by each insurance provider?
