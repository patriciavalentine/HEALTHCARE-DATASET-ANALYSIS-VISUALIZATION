# HEALTHCARE PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS


## Project Overview
This Data analysis & Visualization project aims to provide insights into the Healthcare performance of several health facilities in the United States.

By analyzing and visualizing various parts of the healthcare data, I sought to identify trends and gain a deeper understanding of the healthcare performance.

### Data Sources
Healthcare_Dataset:
The primary dataset used for this analysis is the 'heathcare_dataset.csv' file, containing detailed information about the healthcare systems' patients' names, ages, genders, medical conditions, insurance providers, blood groups, billing amounts, doctors, days of admission and hospitals attended.

### Tools
- Microsoft SQL Server - Data Cleaning & Analysis
- PowerBI - Data Visualizations

### Data Cleaning & Preparation
In the initial data preparation phase, I performed the following tasks:
1. Data loading & inspection.
2. Checking missing values and blanks.
3. Data cleaning & formatting.

### Exploratory Data Analysis
EDA involved exploring the healthcare data to answer key questions, such as:
1. Is there a correlation between gender and specific medical conditions?
2. What are the most common medical conditions across different age groups?
3. Which doctors are preferred for specific conditions?
4. What is the average billing amount by each insurance provider?

### Data Visualizations
The data visualization of the analyzed data is shown in the interactive Dashboard below:

### Findings
1. Correlation Between Gender and Medical Conditions:

Observation: A slight relationship was observed between gender and specific medical conditions. Asthma had a higher prevalence among males, while arthritis was more common among females. For other medical conditions, the distribution between genders was almost identical.

Insight: This suggests potential gender-specific risk factors or susceptibilities for certain conditions, particularly for asthma and arthritis.

2. Doctor-to-Patient Ratio:

Observation: The analysis revealed that the number of doctors was slightly higher than the number of patients.

Insight: A favorable doctor-to-patient ratio is indicated, which can positively impact patient care quality and reduce wait times. This ratio is a good indicator of resource availability in the healthcare system.

3. Hospital-to-Patient Proportion:

Observation: The number of hospitals was found to be proportionate to the number of patients.

Insight: This proportionality suggests an adequate distribution of healthcare facilities relative to the patient population, which is critical for maintaining accessible healthcare services.

4. Age Group Distribution Across Medical Conditions:

Observation: Seniors represented the largest age group among patients across almost all medical conditions, followed by adults, young adults, and children.

Insight: This age distribution highlights the greater healthcare needs of senior populations, likely due to age-related health issues. The data emphasizes the importance of geriatric care and resources within the healthcare system.

5. Insurance Billing Analysis:

Observation: The average billing amount by insurance provider varied significantly, depending on the medical condition.

Insight: This variance indicates that certain medical conditions require more expensive treatments or longer hospital stays, leading to higher billing amounts. It also suggests that insurance plans may need to be tailored to better manage the costs associated with specific conditions.

### Conclusion
The analysis of the healthcare dataset provided valuable insights into the relationships between patient demographics, medical conditions, and healthcare resources.

The slight gender differences in condition prevalence, the favorable doctor-to-patient ratio, and the proportionality of hospitals to patients all contribute to an understanding of the healthcare landscape. Additionally, the significant differences in average billing amounts by insurance provider underscore the need for careful consideration of healthcare costs associated with different medical conditions.

These findings can inform strategic decisions in healthcare management and policy-making.

**This comprehensive analysis process highlights my ability to effectively clean, prepare, and analyze complex datasets using SQL, and to translate these insights into meaningful visualizations using Power BI. By uncovering trends and relationships within the data, I demonstrated strong analytical skills and a deep understanding of healthcare data.**

*My approach to data analysisâ€”ranging from identifying key patterns to generating actionable insightsâ€”exemplifies my readiness to take on challenging projects and deliver impactful results in any data-driven environment.*
